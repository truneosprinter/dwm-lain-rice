# DWM lain rice
--- This rice was inspired by the TV show Serial Experiments Lain ---

A simple rice that I put together, minimal functionality but it works with LOTS of eyecandy via picom
just move .bashrc and .wallpaper.jpg to the home, and the folders to .config. You can make a .xinitrc file too (I forgot to include that here - my bad!)

Hope you like it!
